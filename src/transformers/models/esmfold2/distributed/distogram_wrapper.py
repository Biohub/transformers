"""Distributed distogram head for ESMFold2 (inference-only).

The serial op is a single channel-wise Linear over the symmetrized pair:

    distogram_logits = distogram_head(z + z.transpose(-2, -3))   # (B, L, L, bins)

``z.transpose(-2, -3)`` swaps the two token axes (rows i <-> cols j). Under 2D CP
the pair is sharded ``(Shard(0), Shard(1), Shard(2))``; the (p, q) rank's
transposed tile ``zᵀ[i∈p, j∈q] = z[j∈q, i∈p]`` lives on the transpose peer
``(q, p)`` — one ``TransposeComm`` fetches that tile, and a local axis-swap
arranges it. The Linear is per-pair channel-wise → local. Only the small
``bins``-channel logits are gathered (vs. the full ``d_pair`` pair), so the full
``z`` (256 ch) is never re-gathered for the distogram.
