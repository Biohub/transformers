"""Distributed DiffusionConditioning for ESMFold2's structure head.

The conditioning produces, from the trunk pair ``z_trunk``, the per-head bias
source ``z`` (``B, L, L, c_z``) that biases the diffusion token attention — the
**dominant** diffusion tensor (``L²·c_z`` ≈ 4.6 GB at L=3000, far above the
per-layer attention scores). To get any diffusion memory win this ``z`` must be
sharded, so this module produces it as a 2-D-sharded DTensor
``(Shard(0), Shard(1), Shard(2))`` rather than the full tensor.

The ``z`` path (``z_input_norm`` → ``z_proj`` → ``z_transitions``) is entirely
pair-channel-wise (``TransitionLayer`` is LayerNorm + SwiGLU over the last dim),
so it runs **as-is on the local pair shard** using the serial submodule's
identically-replicated params. The ``s`` path (token single repr, cheap 1-D) runs
**replicated/full** exactly as serial.

Caller owns padding: ``z_trunk`` / ``rel_pos`` must already be padded so the token
axis is a multiple of the CP shard factor. Inference-only.
