"""Tensor-parallel ESM-C over the CP ranks (inference-only).

The replicated ESM-C 6B forward is the dominant per-rank floor (T0 re-hook:
~19.8 GB live, identical on every rank). Tensor parallelism shards its weights
AND intra-block activations across the CP ranks.

**Phase 1 (this module): the SwiGLU MLP** — ~67% of ESM-C's params. Each
``UnifiedTransformerBlock.ffn`` is a Transformer Engine ``LayerNormMLP``; TE has
native TP (``set_parallel_mode=True`` → column-parallel fc1 with the SwiGLU
gate/up split handled internally + row-parallel fc2 + an internal all-reduce), so
the wrap is: construct a TP ``LayerNormMLP`` over the CP process group and copy the
full weights in sharded. The MLP's ``ffn_hidden`` (6912) divides 4/9/16, so this
works at every CP grid (unlike head-parallel attention, blocked by n_heads=40).

Validated bit-exact (modulo bf16 rounding) under ``torch.inference_mode`` — the
column/row shard + internal all-reduce reproduce the serial output; the ESM-C
forward already runs under the model's ``@torch.inference_mode`` so TE-TP (plain
sharded matmuls + NCCL, no autograd hooks) is inference-safe.

Attention TP (qkv column + out_proj row + the full-width QK-LayerNorm all-reduce,
constrained to TP=4 by the 40 heads) is a later phase — see ``fix_9x_ESMC_TP.md``.
